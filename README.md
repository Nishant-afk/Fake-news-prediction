# Fake-News-Prediction

Our Fake News Prediction project is ML based project to predict whether the given news is Real or Fake.

We have used dataset from kaggle for fake news detection.
The dataset consists of 20,000 records which is then divided into training and test Data for model training

## Logistic Regression:

Our model uses Logistic Regression model for training. 

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didnâ€™t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1.

Similarly, our model gives binary output as 0 or 1 (i.e Real or Fake)
